An advanced pathfinding simulation combining **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** with **Heuristic Search (A*)** to navigate dynamic, procedurally generated mazes. This project demonstrates how a hybrid AI architecture can solve complex navigation tasks involving multiple objectives, static traps, and dynamic adversaries.

### 🧠 Hybrid AI Architecture
* **Strategic Layer (Q-Learning):** High-level decision making (e.g., "Should I go for the key or the goal?").
* **Tactical Layer (A* Pathfinding):** Optimal path generation between objectives.
* **Reactive Layer (Heuristic):** Real-time collision avoidance to dodge dynamic enemies.

### 🎮 Dynamic Environment
* **Procedural Generation:** Every run features a unique maze layout using Recursive Backtracking.
* **Dynamic Enemies:** Smart patrol agents that wander the maze and hunt the player.
* **Multiple Objectives:** Configurable number of keys required to unlock the exit.
* **Hazards:** Static traps and walls to navigate around.

### 📊 Analytics & UI
* **Cyber-Themed UI:** A polished, modern configuration menu to tweak simulation parameters.
* **Heatmap Visualization:** Post-run analytics showing agent death zones and traversal density using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* **Real-time Dashboard:** Tracks wins, losses, and current strategies during gameplay.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Agentic-Maze-Runner.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Agentic-Maze-Runner.git)
    cd Agentic-Maze-Runner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install pygame numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Run the Simulation**
    ```bash
    python main_app.py
    ```

> **Note:** If you want to retrain the agent from scratch, delete the `q_table.npy` file and run `main.py` (the training script) before running `main_app.py`.
